I don't use fancy tools and screenshots to take notes so here you'll find my notes taken with vim and polished with markdown. If a note skips some steps or something doesn't make sense it probably doesn't make sense to me either and I've long forgotten about it. I created this blog specifically to get better at keeping notes. I will probably still only use vim though..

Non-retired htb notes are **AES256-CBC** encrypted with root hash.

I have been a big fan of textfiles as some of you might've guessed.
